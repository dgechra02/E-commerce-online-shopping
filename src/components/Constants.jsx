      "PRODUCTLIRAMARK Webcam Cover SlideEVENTS DATESOrder Date - 09/04/2022Delivery Date - 11/04/2022Review Date - 05/05/2022STATUSReceived and AcceptedRATINGS4.2/5.0DESCRIPTIONUsed terms in the description -->> Slider - Sliding part of webcam cover> Static Frame -  Static back frame of webcam cover> Screen Frame - The laptop's screen frameThe product is sturdy, invisible (for the mutual color theme for device and product), and well manufactured. If the device has the same matte black theme, this webcam cover can easily be merged and becomes a part of the device's body. As you can see my laptop has a matte black screen frame and astonishingly the product has merged with it. The little plastic container in the package will act as storage for the rest of the webcam covers.It is ultra-thin as described by the company with acquiring about a millimeter thickness. This thickness can cope with the windows laptops as they are having the rubber buffers on the top side of the screen frame because those buffers act as a spacer between the screen and the lower-up body/keyboard of the laptop to avoid any harm to the screen. This spacer is advantageous to the webcam cover as closing the lid will not harm the screen, screen frame, and laptop lower-up body. But, still, don't put pressure on the location where the webcam cover is installed as the thickness of the webcam cover is slightly more in the micrometers, than the rubber buffers of the laptop itself. The sliding function is very smooth, but be sure to push only the slider part and not the whole static part as it will make the grip weak over time of usage.The device can be used with any phone and monitor as they have no issue with opening and closing the lids.Now, for the \"Mac Laptop '' users, it is not a product for your laptop, and never try this product for your Mac laptops. As the Mac laptops have a stunning plain glass screen that is covering the whole screen frame part and has no spacers, that is there's no space left after closing the laptop lid and hence upon installation of this product will damage (crack/break) the plain glass screen.Installation is easy, remove the blue tape and carefully stick the cover as a sticker, using the scale for support, or else you could stick it a little inclined. After sticking, rub your palm for heat generation and grab the screen frame from both palms and apply the ultra-light pressure and hold the position up to a good 2 to 5 minutes. And there you go for your satisfied invisible life.*Important - Even if not in use, slide it 2-5 times once a week and clean it as per your device cleaning schedule to avoid jamming due to debris or dust.Overall, it is a good product. For me, it has worked awesome. Green Signal from here.Thank You :)SUGGESTIONSTo the Manufacturer - Notice the static frame of the webcam cover, and make its edges (the edges close to the slider) smooth (rounding off or fillet), so that upon sliding the slider with a fat finger, it can easily slide over the edges of the static frame hence do not put an unnecessary force on a static frame.To the Seller - Well packagingTo the Consumer - Check for the rubber spacers/buffers provided in the laptop (like Windows laptops), if it is then you can use the webcam cover, if not (like Mac laptops), it's not the product for you. Even for Windows laptops, after installing a webcam cover, try not to put pressure on the webcam cover location for long. Slide it 2-5 times once a week to avoid jamming.DISCLAIMERThe review(s) and rating(s) has(ve) been made upon personal usage(s) / experiment(s) / experience(s) / perspective(s) for specific product(s) acquired / delivered.,I usually don't trust my webcam so I thought of giving this product a try. It was delivered within 3 days after placing the order. I received it on 12th June. First impressions were really good. I always had a fear that It would crack my screen when I close my laptop lid after reading the reviews but It's been 3.5 months and there's not even a single crack in my screen.𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 𝗤𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝟰.𝟱/𝟱You will get 3 webcams covers in the package. It's extremely thin. So, It won't cause any issues when you close the laptop(Hp pavilion gaming used here) but It might cause issues in the case of laptops with thin screens like MacBook Air, Asus TUF, Asus ROG while closing the lid due to the pressure on the screen. At the end it's your choice.𝗔𝗱𝗵𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝟯/𝟱I am sorry to say that the Adhesion of this product is quite weak. It literally falls off after a week of applying it. I had to throw 2 of it as it became useless. I only had the last piece remaining.𝗦𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗔𝗱𝗵𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 : Eventually I was able to find a solution for this problem.• Remove the Stock Adhesion by gently applying Isopropyl alcohol.• Then apply a strong Adhesive glue (I used Fevi Kwick). Apply it only on the back edges of the webcam  cover. Since it's extremely thin, I used thin needle to apply Super Glue gently on it or else the Superglue  will spill out and make a mess.• Immediately you have to place it on the webcam of our laptop. And then you're good to go.Its been 3 months after using the Super Glue technique. Forget about about falling, It has not even moved a bit. No effect on the quality of my webcam. The cover won't interfere when you are using your webcam in meetings. And fully covers it when you want privacy. Overall, Its a good product except for the fact that it has poor adhesion.,Good product,I wish I had known this before ordering. Luckily a friend made me aware the very same day I had applied it.Apple urges people not to close their MacBook, MacBook Air or MacBook Pro, while such camera covers are applied because it can lead to cracks in the screen when closing your MacBook!!! It may also affect the ambience light sensor, but that is the lesser issue as compared to a potentially cracked screen and high repair costs.MacBooks are designed in a way that when closing no foreign object thicker than an average printer paper (0.1mm) should ever be between the screen and the body of the laptop. This item is 0.027inches thick, that is 0.6mm, six times the recommended thickness!!!If you are going to use it on your MacBook, be sure to completely remove it before closing your laptop. You can use it without worry on iMac as it's a desktop and doesn't get closed. You can also use it with any normal laptop where the camera isn't embedded inside the glass screen. If you have a laptop where the camera is embedded in the plastic frame around the screen it should be okay.For disappointed MacBook users like me there are two options. One is you trust Apple, who are saying their camera is hardwired to the green camera light. According to them one cannot work without the other, so even if someone hacks your camera, you will know it is on because the green light will be glowing.If you're not sure about their reliability and you still want to cover your camera, use a piece of thin tape. Apple does advice against anything which could leave adhesive residue on their screen, but frankly, if you just clean it with some screen cleanser after removing, i don't see how there could be an issue.Why am I still giving this product 3 stars? It reached in good condition, is easy to install and use, and it will still be useful to people with other laptops or desktop screens with inbuilt camera. It's not a bad product. They just need to stop advertising it for MacBooks!",

    review_content:
      "SanDisk 1TB Extreme Pro Portable SSD 2000MB/s R/WInitially set up the disk with inbuilt san disk software. The speed was pathetic and after some debugging found culprit in exFat default format. Reformatted to APFS (Encrypted) for similar secure features without comprising features. Surprised to see drastic jump in performance .ExFAT - 48gb write failed after 30 mins.APFS Encrypted - 48gb - less than 4 mins.Pros -PortableSecureSturdySpeedLarge volumeCons-Default software and filesystem.,Will deliver speed in range 7** to 9** MBps on MBP as thunderbolt 4 will only function as 10GBps (USB 3.1) mode instead of 20GBps (usb 3.2),Good,Sandisk is always Excellent! Though this review is about Sandisk Extreme which functions excellently, it is painful to note that this cannot be used in my IPad Pro ( costing more than a Lac rupees), whereas this responsed to my Samsung Tab of Rs.25000 (without any aid of Computer or PC)  flawlessly. Shame on Apple!,I am using this device for the past 1month and the read and write speed is mind-blowing. I especially liked it's portability as well as it is easy to carry and you can use this device on the even on your mobile or laptop. It's waterproof as well rugged . I use this device for my daily use.  Thank you SanDisk for making this device,Had it been up to rs 5000, the middle family would have been able to buy it easily.,Speed is very fast. but it corrupts video file. when i download video files direct into this drive (from internet) files get corrupt.,Perfect travel partner with taking no space at all in my bag.",

      "It's smooth and good quality. The bottom has a finish which stops it from moving... Good product,Better to buy a better one for more price,I like this mouse pad. I have no problem with this item.,I wanted to order a mousepad that wasn't a ginormous waste of money, like adding a gaming brand's logo on a pad shouldn't cost 500 bucks, but here we are.It's a smooth mouse pad that grips the table perfectly. Looks and build quality are good. Stitching looks okay, not a single strand standing out. Though I'm talking from a perspective of a person who needs a mousepad, not a gamer who's on their 3rd mousepad purchase in a year. ( I'm a gamer myself but don't need a proper desktop setup yet).,Not meant for gaming obviously,look at its size man, it feels like you have a kid slave while gaming XD,Good product,Great mousepad, looks subtle, feels good, mice work great on it. Stitching seems like it’ll hold up. Worth it just for the price.,Good quality & comfort. But it isn't washable. Will have to throw it eventually even if it doesn't go bad.",

      "A 10bucks piece can save cable worth hundreds. Totally recommend,I just received it and applied on my iphone related cables and connectors. Specially, apple accessories are not that sturdy and doesn’t last long due to breakage at the end points due to wear and tear.This seems to be a very good and low cost investment to protect all of such cables to break due to usage and wear&tear. Have applied in earphones also. Will be watching over the period if time if it indeed increases the cables life.Till now, feeling good about this useful product.,Price is high,You can go for this.,It is useful. After using it, the durability of the cable is good.,Very good product it definitely protect your cable,It doesn't really protect your cable if the cable is starting to wear out. You need to use this before the cable starts wearing out. It works only if the cable is thick enough. But overall good quality.,Good",

      "The product arrived on time and in good condition.It is not only portable but also convenient as it uses a standard plug that can be plugged into normal 5Amp sockets.I mostly just use it to heat my bathrooms as its a low wattage heater and thus can only work well in tiny spaces.IMPORTANT! If using in bathroom, ensure there is NO water on the floor or spraying on/around it. Just heat the bathroom and then move away the heater before using the bath area!!!!,It's a light weight easy to use product.Perfect for small space.Heats quickly.,Best room heater in budget, especially it uses less power nd gives sufficient heating, even can be used with inverter in places where power cut is a problematic issue.,Not so easy to use or regular movement.,I liked this room heater. It only uses 500 watts and so can be plugged into any 5 amps. It's quite as there is no fan. Adequate for a small room.,It looks good and the feel is metalic. There is line indicator in its back and also there is a switch on its side. Heating feels powerful and there is no breathing issue due to this heater.,It was Very useful in my Himachal tour in January. I have used it whole night in -5 °C, with few care ie ventilation in room and few waters in room.,good",

      "Perfect Value for money,Everything is great but you can increase battery backup,Worth the hype....simply good!,Ok product,I love tank so much . I bought it only before 10 days .i have charged it only once after buying .,Watch design is good,Overall Good Experience,Value for money.",
    review_content:
      "Perfect buy for the price of 1999/-After use of 10days my overall rating is 8/10 following are my reviews.Pros:1.step counting accuracy 85-90%2.sleep monitor 95-100% accurate3.Notifications and bluetooth connection with IOS and android - 10/104.touch sensitivity 9.5/105.watch brightness in bright sunlight - 9/106.customisable watchface and easy interface - 9/107.call quality and speaker volume - 9.5/108.Sports modes 9.5/10Cons:-1.battery life 6/10 when fully connected for notifications and calls lasts 3/4 days only. Else if used optimally, can last 7-8 days with moderate use.2.less choice of inbuilt watch faces3.Watch strap could have been of better quality.4.Screen can catch scratches, need to buy a cut screen guard for the screen.Overall this Smart watch is a beast in this range (₹1999)P.s: I have used colorfit pro 2 earlier. Ratings and reviews are according to that.,Everything is great in this Watch it dose have calling , games , fin perfectly in all hands health tracking and etc, but after all watch is great but there is only one con - batter backup is less battery gets discharged in just 15 hours if you will keep it wear all day , i hope fire boltt will fix it. Overall best value to money product 👍👍👍,Many watches comes with the same features at the same cost so u may have a lot of varieties to get confused with,though i can say that this one i got here has stable ui,no lag even,feels premium (mainly the soft strap and the cool crown button adds up much)..the main reason I bought this because it brings all the features everyone needs today with out of the box looks.If someone feels that they have a thin wrist and it wouldn't fit them,don't worry.Even i thought it wouldn't fit me coz i have a thin wrist but it was just fine.,Got delivery in a day. Prompt service by Amazon. Package was sealed. Did not find any tampering. Watch body is plastic built. At this price point, could have been metal one. Detailed review will be shared in few days,Now after the battery gets fully charged it drains from 100 to 0 % in just 10 minutes .i don't know what happened to it .,Watch design is good. In picture shows dark grey color watch but i recived silver grey. Screen wakeup time is slow otherwise everything is good.,Using this watch for couple of days now. Overall I liked it. Readings are almost correct. Hope it'll be durable as well.,Value for money.Only con is that rise to wake up sensor works very slow.",

    review_content:
      "Useful for dark colour n delicate dress,What an amazing product. Was quite sceptical before buying it after reading all these mixed reviews but glad i did.Smoothens out the creases from dresses, coats, woollens and any fabric which is otherwise non iron-able. Of course, you can’t expect it to crease out the cotton shirts but It is a very handy product, especially if you are travelling. Also, the steam sanitises the clothes making them odour free.The water tank is small and needs to be re-filled again after about 2 clothes but bigger tank would have made it heavy and difficult to operate.Overall, good purchase.,Loving this product while using,It does the job pretty well.The cons according to me are 1. You cannot use it with clothes placed on horizontal flat surfaces. Because the water doesn’t reach the outlet in the tank if the tank is half empty. The alternative is that the dress has to be hanged to a cloth hanger and then use the steamer.2. Be careful while steaming as it may burn the skin. Keep you palm at a safe distance while steaming the dress. This may be an issue when you try to steam the sleeves of the garment and also for flowing dresses.3. Not all fabrics can be completely wrinkle free.4. It sometimes leaves more steam and water at times leaving your garment with wet patches. The garment feels wet after using the steamer.5. You have to keep filling the tank twice for using it on one top.,Easy to use, sturdy, and does the job, only thing is that it takes time to cool, rest of all good,Its an amazing product and easy to use. Just hang the cloth somewhere and start using this.,Great product..easy to carry..foldable...and results great,An average product but the cost is too high as it doesn’t completely satisfy your purpose.",

      "Achha product hai ...thoda brightness badhane ki jarurat hai ...,After heavy usage for 10days,Pros:1.Battery last2. Brightness depends on the brightness of the place we're using it3. Smooth and Addictive4. Attracts you to scribble something on it5. Best time passMy 3years old boy loves to doodle so to avoid him scribble on everything I bought this for him. Now he lovesssssss to write on it. While other children addicted in mobile📱 I'm proud of my kid 😂 but the misfortune is... It addict everyone so when my son busy playing with other toys we started using it.Cons:1. Color started fading i could see some dark blue at bottom as it's somewhat green colour while writing.2. If we write our palm will be visible in this slate. it's really a drawback. Even if we cautious about it, we're helpless.3.Delete button print gone in a day4.Easily get scratch,Size want to big and need more brightness over product is awesome,I like this product,Very nice & satisfactory,Brightness is very low and depends on the ambient light in the room. Otherwise a great product.,Na,It’s a nice product to use and save paper and for this price range I guess it’s the good option.",

      "Pros:1) Looking at the picture, I thought it would just be the blender with some cap to cover the blade. Turns out the \"cap\" was actually a pretty nice container to blend small amounts of anything. The container itself seems of great quality, has measurements on the side, and also comes with a lid so that nothing splatters outside when you're using the blender.2) There is also a holder with some nails if you wanna mount the blender on a wall.3) The blender itself is amazing to hold, looks great, and is pretty easy to use.4) The blender can even stand on its own if you have to leave it and attend to something else. If you place it vertically, you can leave it as it is.Cons:1) After over 15 seconds of continuous blending (that is, if I'm not just pulsing it but continuously blending), there is this smell of some sort that starts to come from the blender. I'm not sure if that's a sign of overheating, or if it's normal.2) There's this groove right above the blade, and every time I'm done washing, there's always a little residue that was hiding in that groove which always comes out a few seconds after I'm done washing, and I always have to go back to clean that. So that's a small inconvenience.But it's overall great, and I'd highly recommend getting this product!,Good,Making the life easy.,Great durability and original products,Very nice product for small or moderate usage.,Good product,Very good,Very useful product in day to day work",

      "It is working as expected so farNo complaints,Godod,The product is definitely worth the price and keeps the laptop super cool. I am not a gamer and this review is NOT for a gaming PC. Its very convenient for my office work. The cooling pad has an additional usb and it helps in case an additional usb port is required when using the cooling pad.,not in mostly use,Good product..but fan speed is little slow,I tried it on my gaming and office laptop.There was 0 difference in temperatures on gaming laptop.Office laptop (14\" HP core i5 8th gen) did feel slightly cool to touch) with the cooling pad but its ergonomics aren't greatBut its Value for Money. The two fans offer very little airflow and audible noise, in winters!Body is sturdy enough but the laptop slips from the top grillAnd when you use the non slip clips on the front, they come in the way of your hands, while working on the laptop.Your hand essentially rests on those clips and it hurtsDesign needs improvement and fans should have higher airflow. Accordingly, a customer wouldn't mind slightly higher price,It is a decent product and economic in this price range.Fan speed is decent, for better speed give power from your charger.Not recommended for high end performance laptops.,A good product that keeps that decreases  the laptop heat. My dell vostro 3510 with 11th gen i3 would hover at around 60 - 65 c during regular use such as browsing, movies , youtube , ps1 emulation etc. but with this cooler the temps came down to 40 - 55 c . During heavy gaming ( tested with fallout new vegas CPU 40 - 50 % iGpu 99%) the laptop heated up as if there was no cooling pad but the laptop surface felt cooler . Please note that I live in a hill station and the climate is generally cool so your experience may be different. I have not tested this with a gaming laptop .",

    review_content:
      "Somehow Amazon sucks when you want to select an electric kettle. There are no options to filter your choices based on the parameters that matter. It is easy to fall into the trap of an ongoing deal and end up buying something that falls short of what you need. In this review I will answer your questions about the PIGEON AMAZE PLUS 1.5L ELECTRIC KETTLE.1. Can I trust the reviews for this ad? Are they genuine?Probably yes. But know that the seller lists several types of PIGEON Kettles in the same ad. Unless the review refers to this particular model - you could well end up seeing a review of a product and buying a different one. The ratings are also an aggregated mix. There could be 10 negative review of the product you are seeing and 10 positives for the other products. The page will show you a neutral review. That's the game sellers are playing these days - to avoid negative reviews. I have posted a picture of the stove I am referring to in this review.2. WATTAGE: Important because this tells how quickly the water will heat up. This one is 1500W - meaning that you can switch it on ... brush your teeth and find the water is boiled. Great time saving !! My earlier one was 900W and it used to take 10-15 minutes of patient waiting. The gas stove boiled water faster. This one takes about 3-4 mins to heat 2 mugs of coffee3. CABLE LENGTH: Most of these kettle makers skimp on the cable length. I have purchased kettles to find they have only a 2-foot long cable ... and I had to return them. This one has cable length of 22\" (slightly more than one meter) - which is allows a comfortable distance between the kettle and the plug.4.  CONNECTOR:  This one uses a 6A plug - which is most common in India. Be careful because from >1500W onwards, most kettles use a 16A plug and that is not always available at the place where you want to place the kettle. Strictly speaking, it should have a 16A plug, but then this is kept on for short intervals only.5.  CAPACITY:  1.7 litres as mentioned - though I could not see markings for max and min levels. This is good enough to make 4-5 decent sized mugs of coffee6.  COOKING OTHER STUFF:  The ad says only water - but I see no reason why you cannot heat Maggi etc. Maybe you can. But avoid milk as the expanding effect will cause spills and this can have adverse effects.7. LOOKS: Quite okay for the price. It will not make your kitchen look bad - and neither will it enhance the looks. This is the most common look that an electric kettle can have.8. PERFORMANCE: I have used for 2 days only. No complaints so far. There is a 1-year guarantee card accompanying the product9. HANDLE: Very convenient feel when you lift it it from the heating cradle. Does not feel very heavy even if there is a full 1.7L of water.10. NEGATIVES: This is a steel jug. The outside will automatically heat up. If you are used to a plastic outside in your previous kettle, you need to be a little careful.VERDICT - \"BUY\"(at the time of writing this review, this costs less than Rs 700. I have seen that sellers tend to inflate prices as they get my positive reviews - therefore I am also mentioning the price range based on which I gave this product a 5 star review),The body is very lightweight and doesn't feel sturdy. Does the job of heating water fast and that's it. Cord length could be a little longer. The plastic parts doesn't feels sturdy. The top cap has a smaller dia so a man's hand has a trouble fitting it inside the container during cleaning and can easily cut our hands. Overall it's okay.,Its quality was not too much good, light quality product but according to price its okay.Easy to use product & good for save time.,Good product for boiling water. shock proof. So no worries.hahaha,Cattle bass fitting not currently,Good product,Go for it,Amazing  product.",

    review_content:
      "Verdict : A Solid buy for this price segment in 2022 (and even for early 2023)There are 2 reviews in this section. Review 1 is 30 days after purchase (Typos in the Review 1 has rectified now) and Review 2 is 15 days post Android 13 beta update. These reviews are based on my own personal experience of the device purchased here in Amazon on 1 August 2022.Before OOS 13 update, 5G (only for Jio) was enabled via another update. 5G is still not available in my region. Hence, 5G related parameters are not covered in this review.Review 2: After about 15 days of Oxygen OS 13 Beta update (Android 13):(Update received on 1 Dec 2023).Note: After the beta update, no new issues popped up.i.e., there were;No Heating related issues.No fast battery drain.No change in the Charging time.No annoying bugs.No change in camera performance.Beta update is mostly like a Stable update.OOS 13 (Android 13) update review:Delighters:> No new apps added. Absolutely NOT.> System storage consumption remains the same (13.2 GB).> Animations are more fluidic.> More customization UI features added. (Scout widgets in home screen, Enlarged folder & lot more.)> Daily data usage is available in the notification panel and need not be reset daily unlike earlier.> Slight improvement in the Front Ambient light sensor.> Ability to play videos in the background & screen OFF as well (even for YouTube)  (Really a welcoming & longing feature, which other brand UIs have not or only with screen OFF)> Stand-by battery life has improved substantially.Disappointers:> Brightness at lowest level is brighter than before.> No improvement in Sound levels. Still initial 40% is too silent.> No Dolby Atomos (which was mentioned for OOS 13). Perhaps, to wait for Stable update.> Auto brightness latency is higher than earlier. Response time is tad increased.> Haptics have become tighter than earlier, but still not stronger.=======================================================================Review 1:Verdict - A Good Buy in this price range in 2022.Note:- This review is after a month's usage.- Received 2 updates during the course of time (Recent update was of 0.98 GB).- System consumes 13.2 GB space. 128 GB variant is pretty adequate for a normal usage.- N77 band is missing for 5G.- The unit I bought DOES NOT have any sort of heating issues or fast battery drain issue.- Shifting from a 120 Hz to this 90 Hz mobile. No noticeable difference observed. ( In Non-gaming aspect)- Nothing Great or Noting worse in the unmentioned parameters.Things that are delighting;> Exceptional signal reception (especially 4G+ carrier aggregation). Very fast download speeds.> Insane Fast charging (0 to 100% in 40 mins, 30 to 100 % in 20 mins, excluding trickle charge). No heating of the mobile (just slight warming) during charging.> Stand by charge and SoT is fantastic (Even more than 7.5 hrs, for Videos, YT and general tasks and calls, even in mobile data always ON and AOD set to Battery saver.> Oxygen OS = Color OS/Realme OS - Bloatware. The skin is really good & nothing to complain like other brands' UI.> Absolutely no 3rd party bloatware and no ads in the UI or any 2nd party apps. Even some 2nd party apps are \"un-installable\". No major bothering bugs noticed till date.> Yes, the \"Alert slider\" is included, unlike some premium OnePlus models.Things that are annoying;> Dual ambient light sensor (1 in rear and other in front) is not well calibrated. The brightness is always in the lower side and frequent manual increase in required.> Volume level is useless until 40% level (can be audible only in \"Pin-drop silence ambience). Audible enough only post 40% level. Stereo speakers output are 70% bottom and 30 % earpiece. But full volume doesn't distort & is loud enough.> Haptics are tight but not strong, even in higher levels. Effective only post 40% and best only @ 90% level)> Hotspot drains battery quickly (even a warning notification pops up). Also, Chrome and Google app eats away battery quickly. Parallel downloads makes the area near the camera module warm).> Though the in-hand feel is good, the buttons are of no close tolerances and wobbles a bit.> Data billing cycle to be reset daily to show the daily data usage in the notification panel.> The inbuild DAC (no 3.5 mm hole and only Type-C port) is not great. The Dirac equalizer is also not yielding best output. Perhaps, Dolby Atmos support in OOS 13 could improve the audio output.,Overall it's a good mobile phone. The speed and interface is all good but expect battery to last long. Not much, i always keep it in battery saving mode and work for about 18-20 hours on normal use.. not many themes available. Samsung is better in that sense.. there are many wallpapers and themes available. Display is clear and camera is also good! Overall okay.,I got this mobile (12Gb, 25Gb Ram variant)at 31k after 3k discount on icici credit card.For this price it's a must buy.I am using this product since last 2 weeks.The camera is pretty good and the screen and sterio speakers are also working very well.The only complaint I can say is the battery life could have been better, as a working professional it doesn't makes a lot difference for me but who is a heavy user they will need to charge it twice a day.If you have no issues with the battery section then just go for it.👍,Battery drains like any thing. Rest all good.I have to recharge twice a day, don't buy if you want a good battery backup.Even though phone is fast charge, I am disappointed with battery life.,I bought 12gb and 256 and it's working very smoothly, for normal regular use you can go for it.,There is problem with temper glass part , front Cemera area temper glass not installing,Good but not so fast as I think 12gb 256 it's ordinary like 8gb .,Apart from battery and sound quality, everything else is good.",

Better in prospect of charging . It is far better in durability from the original apple wire. Do not think more you can buy blindly worth to buy and it is mfi certified so you IOS device not damaged. But small negative point is packaging quality of the product.,The charger is a great carry on accessory while travelling without risking the original charger.Price is also very affordable and charging speed is very good with good adaptor or power bank.,Good product , can recommend all , only thing I see as issue is the material,, the cable threads peels off when stick to a Velcro materials. Other wise good product, charges very well like original,Nice,Reliable and worth it,The cable shipped in box made by Apple felt less sturdy and reliable after using one or two times and felt it would break more quickly at the lighting port and had to order Amazon basics cable which is miles better and apple MiFi certified,",

BUT 👎When winding down the cable most of the times gets entangled.,Usefull,charges, but doesn't support Apple car play,Built in quality of plastic roll could have been better,Useful, 3 types  in one time charging,The device gets tangled easily if you don't reel it in and out with both ends tangential to the housing reel. Otherwise it is a compact and useful device to have in your car.",

    review_content:
      "This product is good, its only customer support and service that is pathetic. If not for that this product would have had real good rating. I received a slightly defective piece where indicators where not working. I initially raised an issue about it but there was no immediate support for that. As filter was working fine and we didn't require indicators, we didn't bother to follow up. After several days the service guy came and fixed it. First time when the service guy came there was no one. So he came again and got it fixed. For immediate support, its better to reach out to local authorised dealer or service , as going through the official support delays the process. So considering all these I feel product is decent.,Free services are limited. If we change the filter during the free services, we will be charged. Filter is not free of charge during the free services.,Product is good but the service is worst till i experienced  .if your staying in rural areas and your  planing to buy this than i will say don't prefer  because I have called minimum 20 times to the Custer care they always saying that they will send the service person but even no one is calling you to response .If your product is in service period the service person even don't lift your call and say the answer .Once the lady has called me and asked some details after she say it is not come under there area and she will forward it after i think five days has been completed and i called her back she replied rudely and saying i told you this is not come under there area and i asked her atleast give me my area service person number .She gave me atlast and i called the service person and he replied he didn't recieve any complaint id so raise a complaint on service request then he will come .I am frustrated and take my product and went to Guntur to repair it . Previously i done a service with the company servicemen he put a cap on the nozzle of the water pump so it stopped working and it all damaged. They told me you have to replace the pump it cost around 3000 . I have changed it and decided not to call the service person and write a review on Amazon so the people will know about the service centre.,Installation guy didn’t install propery, due to which water was not being purified for last one month. Poor service from eureka forbes,Most Value for Price from Aquaguard,Good,Ok,Tap leakage issue",

      "Very nice,Efficiency is good , cost is little more compared to it's competitors.,Product quality is good but after sales support from LG local services center are grossly disappointing, don't misread into the installation charges. You will be in for a surprise with discrepancies on installation charges. Please ensure you check with LG installation service team before hand.,,Product is good and no issues with Cooling or any other functionality.The installation was expensive, Amazon installation says 1199 + Tax, but the total installation cost is 1199 + Tax + Stand Cost +  others = 2651.Also, the copper wire was missing and the LG installation person told that I need to contact Amazon and they will reimburse, I called Amazon customer care and they said they will reimburse upto 3000, the wire costed me some 3300.Amazon reimbursement is in form of Amazon Pay balance, so I actually ended up paying CASH as below to the LG installationInstallation Cost - 2651Wire Cost - 3300Total - 5951Amazon should look into why copper wires are missing from packages, it seems  to be a regular issue as installation guys were aware of it even before opening the package, it is un-necessary issue and headache for customer buying from amazon.,Good,Noisy at full speed fan mode, but quiet enough at medium to low fan speed.Cooling is good and features are more than enough for normal use. Room temperature display is useful. Remote is good enough.Overall, no complains.,Everything is good and fine. I love it.",

      "Nice product,,The overall quality of product Is good.but please mention that we have to use electric cell and how much to use,The product is nice in its working. The only issue is handling product. There is no On/Off button to start or stop the blender. I need to keep pressing a button to start and release a button to stop it.Also, it is battery-operated, no charging cable connection is available.But overall it is working fine for me in this amount.,Just 30 Seconds and frothy coffee ready.Very powerful.. .. easy to operate as well...the main body of the frother could be made of a better material,Nice product,Product is ok. Does a decent job of frothing. However, the built quality appears to be flimsy. Plastic is quite cheap and delicate. Have to see how long it lasts.Also the seller promises cashback for giving 5 star reviews so all the reviews may not be genuine..,I like it because it is easy toh use and dislike because it doesn't come with batteries",

    review_content:
      "I was looking for durable cable for my ipad cause the cable apple provides in the box feels pretty flimsy, and doesn't really inspire confidence. Also, i use my Ipad primarily for gaming, so it is almost always connected to my pc while gaming.So, i needed a really sturdy cable, that could charge, sync and and feel good while doing it.And this cable does the job perfectly!!It is sturdy. My ipad has taken a few drops my table and was saved my this cable. Even after 3 months of daily abuse, this cable has no signs of wear and tear.The charge speed is the same as the original apple cable. And so is the sync speed.One thing this cable does better than the original cable is the connection quality. It hardly ever accidentally breaks the connection while moving around too much, which was a problem with my original cable.I'm very satisfied with the purchase and i even have a spare one in case of an emergency.,Quality cable material. It feels durable. Charges my iPhone just fine. Thanks Amazon.,,,The product is good, build quality is good and does what's said in the description of the product. But it stopped working within 6 months of usage. The prod was ordered in Apr 22 and now in Sept 22 its  not charging the phone at all.I have contacted Amazon for the same and looking forward for their help.,Used it as a back up to charge phone in car. Apple car play has stopped working intermittently when using this cable,Good product but phn was getting heat while its chrgeing,This cable is working great. It’s durable and charging power is also good.Recommended👍",

I am very much satisfied and would definitely recommend this machine to all potential buyers,Usability,I liked this product but one thing is that there is no light indicater of electricity on/off so,its little bit confusing that wheather it's on or off.,Good product....,The package was not done with Amazon packaging but like a gunny bag type pack.  Not expected. Very poorly haphazard packing.  Will any body look into this?,Keep in mind it makes quite noticeable amount of noise. And after using it for more than 2 years. One of the utensils rotor broke and start making more noise. Other than that a good purchase. And good modern design.,Good,Lid of small jug very loose",

It's very easy to use and clean and is effective. Go for it,It’s one of the most Convenient product and multiple use. It’s durable and easy to use. I really like this product. 10/10.Must buy it.,Great product! Value for money. Go for it!",

      "Over all good, Easy to use.*But do remember there is no existing button to set Hard, medium and soft boil. Its totally depend on how much you have fill water level.Like 50ml for Hard boil,It just different way to fool people to show up Soft, Medium and Hard boil facility.,Good product and does the job as advertised. Autocut off is there, but the power switch doesn't turn off automatically. it should be done manually which we can forget. Once cooled down, this will turn on even water is not there. so switching off is mandatory. i have kept a smart plug with 20mins count down to overcome this issue.,Overall it is a good equipment to boil eggs. But there should have been 1 change in button. It says automatic off, but machine is not really off... It will restart again when machine cools down because power button was kept on.. Button should turned off automatically to avoid restart. Hence 1 star less.,,Used three times so far, boiled 8 eggs each time, and perfect results each time.  Very happy with the product.  Will provide long term review after couple months.  Thanks Amazon.  Thanks Borosil.,Easy to use product,Eggs r clocked perfectly. Follow the manual properly then it will be easy to use.,A very user friendly products. Makes boiled eggs very quickly. Also the feature of making poached eggs is useful.Overall a very good product.",

      "Good one display is good battery life is very good camera quality is good for me finger printer placement is not good can't be used with both hands,Using it from last 3 months now. Battery backup is good , camera is good and in this price range this is one of the good option as of now,The best phone in 2k22 I have purchased in 30sep but on 2dec my mobile stolen during this period I have used 7-8 hrs in a day continuesly but there's no lag problem battery life is good the speaker is not good I think in this mobile there is one problem I face,-Phone runs amazing with the dimensity 810 and I only have praise for the performance-90Hz refresh rate is eye opening coming from a 60hz phone-Build is pretty solid and the back has a nice texture that doesnt build up fingerprints much-Redmi has packed the phone with some neat features such as the IR blaster and the surprisingly amazing DAC which redmi didnt even flex about in the marketing. (my headphones sound miles better out of this phone than my laptop smh)-Included phone cover is alright and its nice of redmi to throw one in (hole around headphone jack couldve been bigger though as it interferes with any aux cables with chonky housings.)-Only complaints id have are that the design is kinda mid; doesnt look very amazing, but nothing to complain about either hmhm-Cannot comment on camera quality as I am a pleb who doesnt know how to nitpick at camera quality :P-Included screen protector is reaally bad( its only been under a month and there are already scratches around the lower screen where id be typing). So highly recommend peeling it off and taking your chances with the Gorilla Glass or just getting something aftermarketOverall strongly recommend if you're into a solidly built phone that focuses on getting stuff done rather than sitting around and looking pretty,Good,If you buy phone for camera purpose then don't buy this. But overall average mobile under this price. Battery backup very good and changing time apx 40-50 minutes for 1 to 100%.,good,It's a good product for normal daily use.Camera quality is not up to the mark.Overall a good product.",

    review_content:
      "It's been only 10 days and used it to transfer 64gb for now.. so i have not used it enough..i would update this after some days.. my relative bought seagate onetouch (Its best competitor) so i would compare it with it..**SPEED**Multiple Photos (32gb): Got 105 mbps max but 95 consistent..Single file(4.2gb):Got 117mbps max and it was more or less consistent..The onetouch reached 133mbps for multiple big files.. didnt check it further..**BUILD**It is very sleek and lightweight.. for sure.. but it does not feel very premium.. it is plastic all around.. you can definitely feel the vibration of the platters while file transfer..the onetouch was very premium feeling..metal and plastic body.. and i could feel its vibrations.. but it was much less than passport.. ( the passport is slimmer and shorter than onetouch ... maybe thats why..**SOFTWARE**My experience has not been much good.. i could not register my product for some days.. the screen got white and did not show anything.. there is no free backup software.. you are asked to backup on gdrive, dropbox or onedrive.. no recovey tool included.. i think it is a paid service ..not sure about the last one..cant say about the software experience on onetouch.. didnt see it.. but it includes 3 months adobe cc if you are into this..**RELIABILITY**Now the big part.. This is the only reason  i bought this one.. otherwise i would no doubt go for the onetouch.. seagate drives tend to fail twice as much as wd drives.. so i could not take risk.. many claim seagate has now learnt from their mistake and d is falling behind by staying in the top spot.. cant say about the first sentence, but quite sure about the second..**MISC**Came with no bubble wrap.. only a plastic tray which was maybe well enough..cable could be a bit better..onetouch's one had grip for pulling it out and seemed better..Has fine texture on body so no fingerprint..onetouch and this one both are same price.. you can go for anyone of these..Sorry for the long review.. But i wanted to tell the buyers the complete story.. would update my review later..,Amzon realy amzing service... If not discount but amzon not provide fake! so i like to buy Amzon product.. 5TB WD Hard Drive Amazing,I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. The HDD is compact and lightweight, making it easy to carry around with me. It is also very easy to use - all I had to do was plug it in and it was ready to go.The 2TB of storage space is more than enough for my needs, and it is a great way to store and back up all of my important data. The HDD is also very fast, which makes transferring files a breeze.Overall, I am extremely happy with my purchase of this 2TB external HDD. It is a reliable and convenient to store and back up my data, and I would highly recommend it to anyone in need of additional storage space.,,Good quality,Happy with this product. Very nice. Do not forget to buy its case separately.,Product is good,It heats up quickly.",

    review_content:
      "The only issue is that the built quality is very poor. It broke on 2nd use. Rest the adhesion is good.,The product is not sturdy, the handle broke after a weekThe adhesive is working, but it is too diffuct to peel the tape,Product is okay but the stick is very delicate so it broke, now it very difficult to use the product.,The handle of the product broke when I used it second time so it's very poor quality would not recommend.,Its value for money,Easy to use,Product of good use. Wish the Handle of the roller was easy  to use,We have a beagle dog so we have extensive use of lint rollers in the household. Have been using the 3M, but its very expensive if you consume 4to 5 rollers every month. So thought of trying this one as i though how bad can a lint roller be. The stickiness of the glue paper was good enough to remove the dog hair, but the quality of the handle is really bad. It did not even last 2 days. So ended up using a wooden stick or long pencils for the job. If the makers had spent some more on making a good handle even if the cost would have been Rs 25 higher, then it could have been a great product especially for those households which have pets as they need it more frequently. So i might go back to buying the 3M product of look for something in between.",

    review_content:
      "Pros -Really like the stylus. It works fine , using it from last two months. Excellent for note taking. Tip quality is good doesn't wearing off. Extra tips provided. It provides all the functions which are mentioned. Charges quickly. Response time is really fast.Cons-Few times it automatically turned off while using, but not a big concern as it happens rarely.Not for professional sketching and drawing as it is clearly mentioned that it doesn't support pressure features.Conclusion -For price under 2k I think it is the best stylus.I am using it with iPad air 5.Didn't face any issues till now so don't know how helpful customer care support is.,So, the quality of packaging and product quality is pretty good. I’ve seen it turn off in just 30 seconds a couple of times but that’s all. By the way, I ordered it for my old iPad Pro 10.5 inch A1701 as I don’t want to buy new Apple Pencil at full price and I somehow couldn’t find the right alternative for 1st gen Apple Pencil either.. but I found some questions here answering it works for A1701.. after delivery, I found out it actually won’t work and then magically the right model of stylus was on my Amazon Home Screen when I wanted to return this. Gonna order a new one which KINGONE says works with A1701. Let’s see..,Very good product build quality is aluminium so feels premium working is good as well best for note taking and basic operations budget friendly .,Full recharge is completed in 18 mins👍 affordable price.👍 Wish Double Tap Gesture as at the apple pencil 2- ND gen.,Ease of use, accurate, all is good upto now and also looks good, feels good, feels premium. Product at this price deserves 5 star,Good product,While using it automatically off's itself this happen when it is in use. But worth buying than a expensive apple pencil ✏,",

    review_content:
      "I installed it myself in my kitchen and it is very useful.,Good,,Heating of water good. But water become so hot u can't put your hand in it , if it mixes the cold or running water with the hot water it will be good. Or water temperature can be adjusted it will be great.,The product is very good. Easy to install and easy to use. The water spray jet is also good with movebale outlet.Water comes out, either hot (60 degree centigrade) or cold (same like your water tank temperature).I thought, I will getting mixed water, as there is no provision of controlling the temperature , always the water is more hot that you even cannot put your hand, and if you bring the knob towards cold, it immediately cools down, so it is either hot or cold, not both.Even if you slightly move the knob towards the hot side, within 3 sec the temperature rises to 60degree centigrade from 30degree centigrade.Was expecting a reostat to control the temperature.Not able to use for the required purpose for kitchen.,Pls do not purchase this items. water does not get hot at all. you reduce or increase water pressure. It's biggest weakness that there is no option to increase the temperature Or last one its price totally worth less.,Wonderful product in this segment and value added product for home during winter,The water gets extremely hot when given in hot mode and quickly gets cold when cold water option is switched.Ideal should be: like geyser, it should have the option for both hot and cold water running parallelly so that a nice warm water flows and things get done.One cannot wash dishes with hand when water is very hot or very cold",

      "About the TV - Wonderful---------------------------------------------------------------Probably the best TV in this price range (INR13000).Good - Google interface, loaded with features, lightweight, 55 watt power consumption, stable designAverage - Sound and Picture quality is quite good but if you compare it with premium brands then obviously not that good.Features- Most of the streaming apps available and compatible- You can connect with WiFi, LAN Cable, HDMI, Set top box, Laptop, USB, Gaming console, Old dish cable, and direct TV antenna as well- Built in chromecast to cast any compatible app directly from phone to TV over same WiFi networkWays to connect phone -1. Via cast feature on mobile apps - no password needed only need to be on the same WiFi network2. Via chromecast app - project only selected media (pics, videos) or entire phone screenWays to connect PC/Laptop -1. Windows cast option - project the entire laptop screen on TV using windows cast option ( need to be connected on same WiFi network2. Via HDMI cableAbout the Amazon installation service - Awful-------------------------------------------------------1. The technician brought a cheap hanging hook that had MRP INR116 on it and asked for INR499 for it without any receipt. He kept telling that it was not for sale and company had sent this specially. However, it clearly had MRP mentioned on it2. I went to market and bought a much better cabinet for just INR200 and for installation of that as well, technician was really adamant to drill the two required holes on top. He just drilled one on top and one on bottom and kept all the other spare screws ( which I had bought ) with him. After about half an hour of arguments, he finally drilled the other required holes. And for all this, he kept cussing me that I wasted his time. There was no assistance from the person who represented the service agency as well.This whole process took me two hours to complete that too with lots of arguments. This was the worst installation experience in my life so far.Bottomline - Please do not avail the 'so called free' installation service from Amazon. It is just a scam. Instead call the acer support. They will do the job much better.,After using it for 2 months, here are it's pros and cons:Pros :1. Great picture quality. It's awesome.2. Blacks are very good and is adjustable.3. Sound with 30db is very good4. Looks great with thin besel5. Remote comes with favorite OTT buttons.6. Content upscaling is very good.Cons:1. Remote could have been better. Can't use DTH remote to turn on both televisison and set top box.2. Remote operation is bit complex.3. Motion technology not great. There is a noticeable blur when watching moving ballson OTT, but it decreases when you switch to DTH.Overall, it's a nice buy at this price point. I think I am getting fairly better picture quality and sound. I am satisfied with the product.,Product has good picture quality. Good product at that price with 25w sound. Applications running smoothly. 3 months older & no issues yet. It's running smoothly.,You get decent features for the price you pay. Screen resolution might be. Set back as you may find pixalation. Overall it's good,I am amazed with the picture quality of this 720p (HD Ready) TV. It is truly an amazing panel. I found it suitable for a viewing distance of between 6 to 10 feet. Any nearer it may not look very crisp and any farther, it will feel like a very small size. The speakers are also very good for the price and can get very loud without any distortions. However, since the speaker is downward firing, the experience will vary based on whether the TV is wall mounted or kept on a stand.The remote is good, voice search works well for me. TV start up takes a long time in my opinion, but I have not compared it against any other 32 inch TV and hence do not know where it stands among peers.5 GHz Wifi works very well even across walls. Only negative aspect I faced is w.r.t the experience of using my bluetooth headphones/earphones. Firstly, the connection sometimes doesn't happen automatically after a  restart - which means I have to remove and re-discover the device thru the menu which is not simple. Secondly, the signal itself seems to be very weak and even at a distance of 8 feet in front of the TV, the signal breaks even if you move your head by 2-3 inches.However, I am still super happy with this TV. I got it for 8k during the launch offer and it is totally worth it and is recommended from my side.,At this price range(₹11499/-)it is good quality product on this market..acer only should work with Sound quality improvement otherwise all ok.Picture quality really impressive,wifi connectivity good,easy to install,boderless screen design is premium and also google voice support is good(sometimes lagging).No major issues found on this TV.Just go for it.,Vellu for money. Good product,Very nice productSave money",

      "I have been using this phone for two months. According to the price range, the battery backup and screen quality of the phone are good. According to this range, the camera is also fine. If we look at the performance, then it is not useless at all, but it is okay. I did not face any problem in calling. The phone starts lagging a lot while browsing or using shopping apps. If I give my opinion then this phone is good for parents.... If you want to buy this phone, then you should compare it with Poco C31, for now there is not much difference in the price.,All is well but sim slot 🎰 damage,It is a very good phone on this price range. Good to use in day today life use.,Hi,A good budget phone,I bought this for office use. Has good battery life. And basic features of android work fine. However, I noticed later that this is actually Android 12 Go Edition. I don't mind using it. But some features are missing (which most people might not use).  Better than Nokia c01 which has Android 11 Go Edition, and on website there is not mention of any update. So, on a budget of 6k you can definitely but this one.,Nice features, budget phone.,I like this product 😍",

      "Decent Product at about right price.,Seems good.,Good Quality & Durable Powerbank in 1k range | Review,This is the second power bank from Ambrane India, i am happy,It’s heavy but good,Good product,Good power bank,The power is bulkier",
    review_content:
      "I bought this power-bank to use during my vacation with family. It is sturdy BUT a bit on HEAVIER side. Can charge three phones at a time if you use the two USB and third Type C port as well for charging. The speed of charging is alright and appropriate. The ONE and only drawback I experienced is the weight of the Power-Bank itself, without this limitation it could be really amazing product to buy.,Bit heavy but does it’s job. Takes tooooooo much time to charge. Whatever mention in the description is not correct at all with regards to the powerbank charging.,I needed an extra power bank with a larger capacity. So this time I thought to give Ambrane a try, as i already have Honor & MI power banks (10000mAh ones). Though it was not a perfect match for MI or Honor ones, iit did live up to my expectations for the 1k range.•••••••••••••••••••🎁 INSIDE BOX•••••••••••••••••••→ Powerbank→ MicroUSB cable→ Carry pouch (depends on which package you received, more below)→ User manual/Warranty card→ General leaflet→ Feedback leaflet••••••••••••••••••••••••📝 SOME DETAILS••••••••••••••••••••••••→ Mfg: October 2019→ Charging time: 9 Hrs 50 Min (via 10W charger, low battery indication to full charge)→ Backup: Was able to charge (5-100%) Redmi Note 5 pro's 4000Mah battery ~3.5 times with regular usage in between.••••••••••••➕ PROS••••••••••••1. High capacity power bank with dual input (micro USB or USB C).2. Dual output via 2 USB ports.3. Not a fast charge/quick charge device but has an output of 5V/2.4A (12W) which is good enough.4. Touch button for power checks or switch it on for charging device.5. It comes with a carry pouch. (more below on this part).6. Compact form factor & sturdy design with ABS body.•••••••••••••➖ CONS•••••••••••••1. It does not auto-start charging when the device is connected.2. Since it has a touch button instead of push-button, it activates accidentally switching it on every time during handling.3. There is a lot of conversion loss & backup is slightly less for a 20000mAh power bank.▶ Cons are significant enough to reduce 1 star. There is scope for improvement (points 1 & 2) in this product in the same range. So ★★★★ device.••••••••••••••••••••💡 LED STATUS••••••••••••••••••••→ 1st/2nd/3rd/4th LED blinking (while charging power bank): Status of charge in terms of no of LEDs blinking→ 1/2/3/4 LEDs solid white (while charging other devices): Status of remaining battery in terms of no of LEDs→ One blinking (while charging other devices): Low battery→ All 4 LED solid glow: Battery fully charged•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••🔊 AMBRANE BOX DEBATE•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••1. When i first received this power bank it came in a small box (approx 12x9x3cm, Mfg: Aug 2019) with everything forced in congested space. The issue i had in this one was that it came with open seal & no poly wrap around product box as if it was a used product or was tampered in between. So was skeptical about the authenticity of the product and ordered a replacement right away.→ This one had USB C cable but no carry pouch.2. When replacement came, it came in a poly-wrapped bigger box (22x10x4 cm, Mfg: Oct 2019) with an outer sleeve and main box inside with a hologram seal. Maybe Ambrane changed the packaging. The hologram seal here was intact but was also not applied properly to secure the opening. Looked like it was applied with an open box. So its presence was useless.→ This one came with Micro USB cable and a carry pouch.••••••••••••••••••••••••👜 CARRY POUCH••••••••••••••••••••••••→ As per my analysis carry pouch comes with the latest October lot which comes in a bigger box and was unavailable in earlier lot with a small box.→ Carry pouch size was appropriate for power bank and i had no trouble inserting power bank in it. (Some users reported it having a smaller opening but i had no trouble with it and found it to be a proper fit. Neither loose nor tight.→ Its soft nylon meshed pouch and is a nice addon.••••••••••••••••🏆 VERDICT••••••••••••••••▶ At the price point its not a bad deal. Its a midway path b/w low quality and high-quality ones. You can very well go for Ambrane, as it makes good quality & durable power banks. Rest, nothing is perfect in this world. For this thing only, 10 days replacement policy from Amazon and 1-year warranty from Ambrame is available.▶ If one can extend the budget by a few hundred, MI power bank will be a better option with a metallic body & better quality overall. I have MI, Honor & Ambrane power bank and their overall rating will be (from low to high) Ambrane → Honor → MI,I am putting up this review after 1 day of usage. This is the second power bank i have bought from Ambrane India overall third power bank for my family. Before to this i have bought their PP-30 30000 mah model and also has MI 2i 20000 mah power bank both were really good, here i am putting together all the pros and cons which i am able to find after 1 day of usage and also a little bit of comparison. My dad uses Redmi note 7, my mom has MI A1 and i am using Redmi note 3Pros:-- Dual Input Type C and Micro USB this is the foremost and primary reason of choosing this power bank over MI or other brands as you don't need to carry two cables if your phone has type c input which in my family 2 out of 3 has  the same- Easy to carry and hold as it is very compact is size i must say in comparison to MI or Ambrane PP-30- Solid and sturdy built- 20000 mah capacity with same lithium polymer batteries these are safer then lithium ion batteries, this i came to know while buying this product-  ₹200 cheaper price than MI- Touch button at the top to know the power status (this is something unique)-  It took less than 1 hour to charge my redmi note 3 from 13% to 100% at 2 cell battery indicator, which is pretty good and almost equivalent to my wall charger best part same time and charging speed in Delhi Metro- I don't know either it is pro or con, both of my other power banks supports Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 Technology while this power bank supports only fast charging at 2.4 Amp, but i feel this has charged my phone better and faster than MI power bank itself. I know a phone must also supports quick charge technology for fast charging but when i use quick charge on my dad's Redmi note 7 (which supports QC 4.0) either from MI power bank or Ambrane PP-30 power bank it kind of heats up the phone, also it fluctuates the power and automatically switches between Quick Charge and fast charging which affects your battery life, so it is safer to charge the phone at optimum current at 2.4 ampCons:-- Very stuffy packaging, it looks like the power bank has been forced fully stuffed inside the box- It has some adhesive tape at the top i don't know why ? which, when you remove it, puts scratches on the top, be careful while removing the same- No torch light, their PP-30 have it- only micro cable inside the box,Definitely heavy but I knew this. I will recommend this, as it has 2 slots so we can charge two phones.,Nice product,Power backup is good.. but the USB cable provided is very bad. It stopped working after few months of usage,Everything is good but the battery don’t last that long when use for charging two device.",

      "Works flawlessly on Ubuntu 22.04 (if installed correctly),Best for kali. Do not read another review.,Nice product,From 0 to 70 …,Good External Wifi Signal Provider,Superb,Awesome and easy to use,Good product",
    review_content:
      'I am using this on an old Mac Mini, since the Broadcom proprietary drivers aren\'t available and the replacement B43 drivers don\'t allow for sufficient download speeds, at least in my experience. I got this device up and running with Ubuntu 22.04 with Linux 5.15.0-56-generic.Google search for "morrownr/8821au-20210708" and use the driver on Github. I\'m using the product "TP-Link AC600" btw. If you are using the other variant sold on Amazon, use lsusb and find out which network interface you are going to have to install drivers for. GIYF.I will admit, this is probably going to be hard for someone who is not generally comfortable with a shell, bash for example. But even though I had never used dkms or iw before, the Github repo along with the build tools available in the jammy repo made it easy enough to get the device working (read the GitHub Readme).To be sure I first got the drivers working in a local Ubuntu VM using Guest Additions to connect to the USB device directly from the guest OS, which also worked.Ultimately, I installed the OS on the host and setup the drivers using USB tethering. I then got the same download speed using this device I was previously getting on my other network interfaces on Windows and Mac, but now on Ubuntu.The device itself is a bit sensitive to the antenna direction when it comes to the impact on download speed. Have been using for about a month now without complaints.,Do not go for reviews that say that it do not support kali. Me and some of my friends all are using it for Wi-Fi hacking and it works really well, it also supports monitor mode. If you are having issues in connecting it to your Kali machine then just go through the web surf a bit and you will find relevant articles on how to connect this TP link adapter to your kali machine. There is also a driver of realtek which you might need to install to make it work in your kali machine.I have given it 4 stars just because the performance if not good as the Alpha adapters which is reasonable for this range of price but in this range and for as a beginner it is the best adapter you can buy.,Nice product. Working fine. My PC is now 5G  Price is too high so giving 4 star,Got the Wi-Fi in one of the rooms from 0 to 70%. Has been working well since a month now. Good alternative to a repeater if only a single device needs to access the Wi-Fi from a corner.,The product is very nice and have good Wifi signal. Using this for over a month now, no complain. But when it for the first time, you need to install the driver on your desktop/laptop from the TP link website to make it operational, which is not very well explained in the manual.,This product is very good,I have buy this product because my laptop don’t support wifi 5ghz band, in 2.5 ghz I receive 30-40Mbps speed only but my broadband plan is 150Mbps.1. Easy to use plug and play windows 102. Good signal i am using another room from router no signal drop , I receive full signal.3. Little bit expensive but go with this because of good signal.4. I receive 170Mbps + download and 110Mbps upload speed on 5ghz and my broadband plan is 150Mbps.I highly recommend this product.,i purchase this product for company use and this is a very good product.',

      "Would have liked the product to be in the company box sealed. I'm not sure why that is not possible these days. It seems to be a common trend to ship in a separate pack. Why can't we have company box pack?,My first purchase on Amazon for which i can give more then 5 star if i was allowed to.It is what you can call total value for money.I have not even checked it by plugging in pc to monitorand don't have to quality speaks for itself.Cable is around 10 mm thick and braiding looks like ithas been pasted on cable by a sheer force its not going to peel away in years.it looks so strong that i felt likei can toe my car with it.Its 10 feet long.Any one wishing to buy a expensive cable should try this cable firstit will not let you down.build quality,look,performance all are excellent.didnt expected i can get so good cable for 900 rs.,Does all it says.,Good 👍,Good product,Perfect cable and I'm getting 120Hz 4k when connected to my freesync-certified TV 55Q80T.Ignore the other expensive cables. The only catch was there was no proper packing and came in a branded polybag stuff which could have been used as a simple carton box to protect it from transportation.,Great value for money.Cable build quality is good.I tested this cable for 4k hdr 60fps and 4k 120hz.,It's of good quality, but most of the times you just need hdmi 2.0, unless you have 8k or gaming @ 4k120hz consoles. Go for 2.0 in all other cases, which support 4k@ 60hz and atmos, true HD, dts",

    review_content:
      "Atlast  I connected successfully. Working good. But sound volume & clarity not adequate. Durability, to be assessed.  Dear amazon.in, tell the seller to write connecting procedure clearly.Manual printing also is bad. I had to struggle.,Does what it says. Works well to connect two Bluetooth devices to any other device like a laptop, smart TV, etc. Can take a bit of time to pair two devices. But the manual in the box helps.Sound quality over aux cable too is good. So, even if you do not have a digital output or RCA you can still use it. Bit bit flimsy and delicate. But then you don't need to move it around everyday.,Disadvantage - the sound and video lag with distance while connecting Bluetooth with headphones.Pairing with headphones difficult (need to wait long)Feels volumes low.,,I got this to add-on to a high-end system, which traditionally doesn't have the facility. However it's often requested when guests come over. I was using a Phoenix transreceiver, but the constant need of charging and the single indicator LED made it difficult to integrate into this kind of application. The optical out is connected to a dual ESS9028 DAC, and the device used for transmission is the iPad Air.This lacks a battery, which is a big differentiator. This means it is not exactly portable, and the form factor reinforces that 'feature'. It is intended to be a desktop unit, and it comes with a reasonable set of cables. The quality of the included cables is quite poor, so it's best to use something else.Compared to the direct input from USB, the overall sound is poorer, with a shrunken soundstage and coarse vocals and treble. Still, this is being used in a high-end system - I suspect with many lesser speaker/amp/DACs it will be acceptable. At maximum output, the level is about 1-2dB lower than a direct USB connection to the DAC.It is around the same as my Signature Acoustics unit, which is 1/3rd the size but uses a battery, and doesn't have a volume control or the bypass feature, or the nice display which is handy if you are close by.The bypass is one of the highlights of this device, it basically connects the two optical ports together in passthrough, and allows you to use both BT and another optical source/receiver - though only either can be used at a time.The build quality is average. It is lightweight enough that a set of decent cables will tip it over backwards, hence the thin cables supplied. The onboard volume control is nice, if a bit redundant given everybody uses their handheld or other device to control volume (I use the DAC remote). It also has only 16 clicks, so the control will be very coarse. The display has no spelling errors and while the resolution is low, it is sufficient for the tasks.Overall, it's quite expensive but is more kitted out than similar devices. The sound quality limitations of BT transmission (compulsory resampling and lossy compression, among others) cannot be overcome even with the fanciest devices and protocols, so I'd rank it close to the top of what you can get as an add-on for a hifi system. For more 'normal' usage, there are cheaper options available.,Excellent product,Bluetooth range is very less,Bought it to connect my old Sony 5.1 blueray home theater with MI 4k box which does not have Optical sound port. It has an spdif optical port which can connect to the home theater optical in",

      "I've been an Amazon customer since 2014/15. This is, without any doubt the best purchase I've ever made.If you have polyester, polyester+cotton, acrylic, acrylic+wool or acrylic+polyester clothes you know that after sometime (maybe years, could be months) they will start to pill. Pilling is those small round blobs on the cloth: make the item look old and haggard, as if they've hand me downs.Well, this product will reset it back to its original look and feel. It's crazy how good it works, on socks, sweaters, mufflers, caps, gloves, fleece jackets, fleece pants, anything that has artificial fibre composition.Don't but the one with battery because you'll be restricted to the capacity of the battery and when it degrades the product is useless - corded is the way to go for me.Five stars without a doubt.,Easy to use and very useful product.,I am very happy,Made Plastic could have been better,Good product ,Works really well...,Removes lint in one go. Good to use. First time user.,Good,Very easy to use and it works really well. Leaves a near nd clean fabric after removing the lint completely.",

    review_content:
      "-------------------------------------------------UPDATE:20/01/2018-------------------------------------------------It's been 5 months since I first got Boat Rockerz 400. Some of the dislikes I've mentioned earlier in my review are no more dislikes. I said the sound is more or less on a flatter side but I'm quite used to it and \"I'm loving it\".. :) the Second point is I said if you are an audiophile then you may not like it but I was wrong. You might ask why... Here is why:After a long gap, I visited my Father who is an audiophile. He has numerous high-end headphones but unfortunately, he got the attention of my headphone and he just wanted to try it. I said yes (I regret it :( ) he paired it with his device and played a song. Boy!! you got to see the grin on his face :D. He said I'm keeping it you buy another one. Poor me was forced to buy another one. A few days back I got another one :(One thing I noticed in two of my purchase isTHE AUDIO CABLE IS NO GOOD. Both my audio cable had the same issue.----------------------------------------------------------------------------So the moral of the story is: Hide it from your audiophile Dad or brother.. they will unceremoniously snatch it from you.Jokes apart, people, you can't go wrong with this purchase. It's worth every square inch.Happy Shopping...END OF UPDATE---------------------------------------------------I got this product 3 days back, and I got it for Rs. 1299( lightning deal of course) This is an honest unbiased review keeping in mind the price of the product:Three days might not be a sufficient time to review this product but sorry I can't help the excitement...----------------------------------------------------Likes:1> Good built quality-------  4/5It is sturdy, for the price the build quality is great. It is not flimsy. The ear cushions are good enough.------------------------------------------------------2> Sound quality------3.5/5If you are an audiophile this is not for you. Bass is decent nothing to go overboard( as noticed in other reviews). Bass is deep enough for the price.---------------------------------------------------------3> Connectivity: pairing is easy connects like a breeze.------ 4/5----------------------------------------------------------4> Dual Mode- Wired and wireless: Boat rockerz 400 comes with an aux cable.If you run out of charge you could always connect the aux cable and use it as a wired headphone. ( I couldn't find a substantial difference in the quality of music between wired and wireless though :) ) I absolutely loved this feature. ------5/5-----------------------------------------------------------Battery backup: I'm impressed with the battery backup of this beast. I've been using it for 3 days for 2-3 hrs a day still its running. So i guess the 8 hr backup per charge is not a marketing gimmick I presume it's true. So far so good. will update it after a month's usage.------------------------------------------------------------Dislikes:1> Sound quality is more on the flatter side. When you compare it with budget wired headphones like Sennheiser CX 180 Street II bass is not too deep. You won't get that ambiance. Boat's website says:\"Don't just be loud, be loud and clear\", Nope... sorry I've to disappoint you on this. When it's loud it's not at all clear. A lot of distortions are there when you are loud.-----------------------------------------------------------2> Comfort: Believe me, it's not at all comfortable for prolonged usage. Your ear will beg you to take it off after 30-45 mins.. If you have high fortitude you can push it till 1-1.20 hrs... If you could go more than that without taking it off for a minute then you are superhuman...-----------------------------------------------------------3> Range: Boats says 10 meters range... In my experience, if you go beyond 5-6 meters then the voice will break. You will never ever get 10 mtrs range trust me on that. And I'm experiencing occasional breaks in the streaming nothing intrusive so far but I don't know whether it will be a problem down the line. Will let you guys know about it later if it's a problem.------------------------------------------------------------- 4>Flimsy aux cable: I can't complain too much about the aux cable keeping the price in mind. Remember I paid only 1299 for it. But with certain devices, the aux was not working properly. Mi note 3 had issues, Mi 4 also had issues with aux. Not sure whether it's the problem with my device. But it worked flawlessly on my laptop.--------------------------------------------------------------5> Wafer thin service centers: Boat gives 1 yr warranty but what good is it if you can't find any service centers near you. This is a hit or miss guys...---------------------------------------------------------------6> Voice cancellation: I didn't find this effective. Maybe it's just me, not sure.----------------------------------------------------------------7> Microphone is pretty much useless. You can't make calls with this headset.-------------------------------------------------------------------Some alternatives:( These are all wired headphones, comparing them with a wireless may not be a good idea but still, I compare it with them because Boat rockerz comes with an aux cable, and if you are looking for an alternative irrespective of wired or wireless it might be of some use to you)1>Sennheiser CX 180 Street II : I don't think Boat can beat this one's quality. The sound is incomparable- the base is deep, nice fidelity, nice ambiance and for a price of 799 this is unbeatable budget wired in-ear headphone. I own 2 of this beauty. Total value for money. If you are an audiophile and are on a  tight budget then I can't a better alternative than this.2> SoundMagic E10C In-Ear Headphones with Mic (Black/Gold): This is another TVFM earphone3>Sony Extra Bass MDR-XB250 On-Ear Headphones--------------------------------------------------------------------Don't buy it:1> If you are an audiophile ( obviously audiophiles will go only for wired headphones :D )2> If you intend to use it for long hours.----------------------------------------------------------------------Buy it:1> If you are looking for a budget wireless headphone with decent built quality and performance.2> If you require a wired and wireless package in one..-----------------------------------------------------------------------Verdict: I'd give this headphone a score of 3.75/ 5If you are on a budget and you want to enjoy a hassle-free Bluetooth headphone with good performance then CLOSE YOUR EYES AND BUY THIS BEAST trust me you won't regret it you won't be disappointed. In this price range, I couldn't find any other headphone with such a performance. We don't have many options.... Do we?  :P :PThe actual price is Rs. 2999 and Amazon claim they are giving 57% discount. pls don't fall for that. I would not recommend paying more than 1700 rupees for this headphone.--------------------------------------------------------------------------Note: I'm not an expert in this field. This is just a lay man's review.Thank you for reading the review and I hope this will help you with your purchase decision..,My boat wired in ears were giving out after hard use and i wanted a new pair of headphones and i wanted them to be over the head types like this one. I also wanted one with both aux and bluetooth options since i would be using it for the TV, Laptop and my phone. I have fumbled with this strata of the headphone market previously and after buying good for nothing ones from motorola, i chanced upon this.Value for moneyGood bassNice sound qualityGood build, but not premiumIf you can get it below 1000 rs, then it is a very good deal,its difficult to let go of  my boat headphones , i bought this on 2019 for a 1k price on sale , the bluetooth was working fine but it went off after an year , i know this would happen , and thats when the legendary aux cable comes in , ive been using it with the aux cable for almost 2 years again , but later the top headphone band broke off , i used a fevistick to stick it up , and used it , i stretched it even further but it broke again , but there is no difference in soundquality what so ever so far , its been a soldi 3 years since usage of this product , still trying to stretch it further , if it doesnt work , i may hvae to say good by to this beast of a product , and its sad to note that the current boat products on offer fail to deliver this robust quality , they've become the company that focuses on quantity over quality nowadays , evolutions aside , i gotta respect this product for what it has given me so far .,I genuinely reviewed after 2 years and it's still working but once head strip was broke i fixed it by using YouTube video overall it's very good purchase for me.,Don’t think about specs you can blindly buy because it worth it,I recently purchased the boAt Rockerz 400 Bluetooth headphones. They have great sound quality and the soft padded ear cushions are very comfortable. The battery life is also impressive, with up to 8 hours of playback. Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase and would recommend them to anyone looking for a good pair of Bluetooth headphones.,Under 1300 rs it is best head phone.... sound quality super, bass good, noise cancelation not bad, product weight not heavy.,Nice headphone, nhi,bole to jhakas😜Sound quality is very good and bass is also  good but I was expecting more like theatre bass but not like that, hhh laalach karna buri chijh h🤩🤩, hum sudhrenge nhi kabhi😂😂I think u r bored sum of this headphone  mast hai😂😂 enjoying,Good quality, easily connected my lg 4k smart tv",

      "If you are using a seperate mouse go without cup holder it'll give you some space otherwise it's fine for even 15 inch laptop. It's strong and sturdy but it should be 350 to 400 not 599.,Everything is perfect - the sturdiness, the color, the finishing, the height, the weight. The only con is that it can be a little shaky if you use it on the bed.,The table is lightweight and less durable but it serves it's purpose.it's a good product for its price don't expect too much.,Product is good but  price (569 rs) is little more higher than over all quality of product and also there is no logo of amezon basics,It's good,I think the mobile/tablet holder is useless,Material is of good quality and product is worth for money. It would be nice to have a lock mechanism so that stands doesn't tend to close once placed in surfaces like bed.,The table is very strong. Will not break easily.But its legs are not stable at all. If you keep laptop on it and is not supported, then the whole table will fall sideways. It happened twice to me.",

      "The cable build quality is good for normal charging its great cable but doesn’t support quick charging,Works for charging but other applications are hit or miss.Example my external keyboard doesn't work with it!,Best quality and length of wire was qute good and durability also good .,The cable is awesome and no charging issue till now.... Because it is a braided cable... Chance of it damage are very less... Overall... I like the product 🤞🏻,Using this cable from past 40 days to charge lg g7thinq and samsung s21fe.  So far super,Good,Seems durable but there is a problem with the design that the pin is not long enough / base of the pin is too thick that i couldn't insert it into my phone's charging port without removing the case!,Over all quality bht achhi hai bs jo braided material use hua hai wo nylon nhi hai cotton type ka hai lekin ₹99 me 1.5m cable k hisaab se bht achhi hai majboot hai or charging bhi thik hai. Maine chapti wali buy ki thi jo photo me dikh rhi hai lekin delever ye gol wali hui jo ki jada better look deti hai. Agar ₹150 me mile to mt lena utne layak nhi hai.",

    review_content:
      "I have been using this mouse for like 2 months and this is the best mouse under 500.the mouse has the basic gaming stuff like extra buttons dpi settings, but the main thing is the software like you can customize so much on this mouse the RGB is fully customizable, you can set many macros you can revamp the keys and also change the dpi values. these features usually come in expensive gamming mouses, but this is very good for this cheap.the design is also very good and one thing you should note before buying is that this mouse is big like it is big as my hand so if you got small hands, you should think twice, but it doesn't affect that much i got the hang of it in like a week.it doesn't come with any warranty so thats a con. but a part of it, everything is so good.Really would recommend,this mouse is very good for gaming, the high dpi sensor on this mouse is very good. their is no drifting. the rgb is very goodi have used this mouse for about 3 months and its still intact, no problem with scroll wheel or side button,the software provided by redgear is also very great and has lots of features.i mostly used this mouse for fps games like (csgo, valorant, overwatch)but the side buttons also help in building in fortniteonly issue is the build quality, some party feel kinda lose,its my first gaming mouse but damn its so good. the grip is perfect and dpi is also good at this range you shoud go for it if you get it under rupees 500.,No words. Just excellent. Accuracy top notch. Feeling while in hande is awesome. Feels very big in hand. Very comfortable to hold for long time. Design is very good.,nice mouse love it... decent mouse with ecent price..,If you are buying this mouse exclusively for gaming, don't cause the polling rate is no different than lets say a cheap dell mouse you see at work (exact polling rate of this mouse is 125hz which is very low if you want precise aiming in competitive). But the redeeming feature might be the looks. The rgb looks cool (but you cant use just one single color). It feels great in hand but my thumb has to pull back a lot to press the lower side button but that can be attributed to my long thumb. The cables braided too so there's that!Verdict: Great value is you can get it for around Rs. 400 considering its looks and other subtle features.,,A fine mouse for what it's worth.",

    review_content:
      "Purchased 10 liter and 3kw model for faster heating. It takes about10 minutes to heat water from room temperature to its highest temperature setting. Faced one problem in this heater on very Frist day of installation. The green light indicator which indicates heating in progress stopped working on first day. Called the vguard technician and he said there is problem with voltage selector knob. Vguard should look in to quality control as other users have also reported this green light indicator problem. giving one star less for this problem. This water is working good otherwise.,The heating system worked perfectly. However, the digital display was faulty. There was a replacement option available when we bought it. But when we opted for replacement the product was our of stock. Hence, we had to return it.,Using it from last 1 monthTill now no problem & working very fine,Easy to use, quick heating overall nice product to consider in given price range,same day Installation provide by V guard thru v-guard whatsapp contact because before the delivery i booked for installation... installtion price 350+ 250 for Steel inlet outlet pipe because this model didn't provide inlet outlet... overall my experiece is amazing with this gyser it take 30-45 min for full heat my dial is set for 45 degree+but u can use the hot water after 10 min. of heating... look wise cool and simple... i recomended to all of you go for this product 100%,Good,Good performance-- Geyser,Nice",

    review_content:
      "It cost should be under Rs. 500,Buy it,Color is as per the photo but takes longer to charge. Also doesn’t charge on all sockets.Seems to work better when plugged in directly in the laptop.,Length of the cable is long so that you can happily use it for long distance as week and quality is really good,1 meter pInk charging wire for iPhone X long and strong one for use..,I have been using this lighting cable for almost a month now and the cable turned out exactly as it was shown. I took the rose gold one that matches my phone’s color. Although the metal ends of the cable was rose gold, but the whole cable was pink, which I didn’t like. I went for the 2m long cable so that i can use it conveniently even if it is charging. Though it’s kinda bulky, yet serves it’s purpose. Charging speed is fast and efficient just like the original cable had. Also quite durable and sturdy. My Apple’s original lighting cable had some problem while charging so I purchased this one after watching many YouTube videos and reviews. It was indeed a good purchase.,It’s long and good,It’s a superb product in terms of sturdiness, looks, and charging speed.",

Yeh ghadi tik-tik toh nahin chalti but it has made my life tracking theek-theek for sure since the day it is with me. I love this watch. The accuracy, colour (black), weight, apperance, etc. are so so so amazing.Giving 4 stars because its mobile app sucks for real. Mobile connectivity has a lot to be improvised. It could have been upto the mark agar ghadi banane pe itna kharcha kar hi diya hai toh :(,Nice product and user friendly compare to other smart watch.,Nice watch,Noise is best...it's very useful product,I like,After 6 months the charging is not working,Good productI hv used this product since 1 year",

    review_content:
      "Product is very handy but the water capacity is too low!Disappointed with the product's pricing considering its wattage and usage time. You can't iron more than 2 clothes before water refill.Since the mouth area is not that much, you'll need to move it so many times slowly on the whole cloth.Steam amount is fine but design is such that you can't press it hardly on to the cloth during ironing.So overall do keep in mind before buying that it's only for emergency & travel purpose for de-wrinkling already ironed clothes.,Good product. Does what it says. Though the water tank could have been bigger.,better to buy normal iron box,Takes a lot of time and is not very easy to use. You will need to use the conventional iron even after using this steamer for most of the clothes. Works only for the synthetic fabrics. It's better to stick to the conventional iron.,Hiii the water tank is too small and can only use for one shirt or T shirt,so plz concentrate on this also,Absolutely good. Easy to handle and flexible movement. It took me less than 5 mins to iron Kurti.Advice to users - please follow the instructions carefully, have some patience and it works great.Negative - Water chamber is very small and it takes 1 full tank to iron 1 shirt/1 kurti.,The Product is good, unfortunately it came withou a manual. I had to figure our where the water tank was and use it . Otherwise the product works well.,Very low water storage is what put me off. Otherwise its just ok. Does the job. But at times need to refill water even for single garment",

The range of colours covers all tones desirable. She has been in love with it since the day it arrived.I couldn't resist myself from using this set (of course, when she was away😃). The colours are smooth and bright, blends very well. It is good for any types of portraits, even those with bold colours.,Easy to use,Good product but easily breaking in pieces when applying more pressure,Good",
